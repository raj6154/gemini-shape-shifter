# 🦎 Gemini Shape-Shifter: The Autonomous UI

### *Level 10 Hackathon Submission*

**Gemini Shape-Shifter** is not just a dashboard; it is an **Agentic Interface** that re-writes its own code in real-time based on the data you provide.

Powered by **Gemini 3 Flash (Preview)**, this application demonstrates the future of "Generative UI."
